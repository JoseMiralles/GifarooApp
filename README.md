# Gifaroo
This app allowed users to edit gifs from any website, edit them, and then they were able to share them as video files to places like Instagram.

(I took it down because of compatibility issues with most newer phones that have the ARMV8 architecture) And because it became irrelevant.

## Why did I build this app?
I wanted to build something after reading Rob Mile's C# book and taking a couple of C# courses in Microsoft virtual academy.
