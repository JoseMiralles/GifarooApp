# Gifaroo
This app allowed users to edit gifs from any website, edit it, and then they were able to share it as a video file to places like Instagram.
(I took it down because of compatibility issues with most newer phones that have the ARMV8 architecture) And because it became irrelevant.

## Why did I build this app?
I wanted to build something after reading Rob Mile's C# book and taking a couple of C# courses in Microsoft virtual academy.
