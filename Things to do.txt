The following are things that need to be implemented ASAP::::

Support for other file-types:
	
	- Download:
		-- Nodes with any tag ending in gif, webm, gifv, or mp4.
			This is because sites like tumbl store the image source in tags like "file-srcs:'awfeewaf.webm'"
		-- Check the clicked node and it's child nodes.
		-- Use a JavaScript library that supports longclick withot messing with drag and drop functionality.

	- Conversion:
		-- There might not be a need to convert, check if files can be loaded into a webview, and if they work fine in the save activity.




Better GifarooImageView highlighter on editGifActivity

	- Something with rotation functionality and a white or blue border.



Text Timeline, allow users to select when text appears and dissappears in a gif.
